## Collections

### LinkedList-Reverse
A simple Java project demonstrating how to reverse a singly linked list. Great for learning basic data structures and linked list manipulation.
- Features: Implementation of singly linked list, reverse function, example usage.
- [See details and usage](DS-Algo/collections/LinkedList-Reverse/README.md)

### QueueWithTwoStacks
A Java implementation of a queue using two stacks. Demonstrates how to achieve FIFO queue behavior using only LIFO stack operations.
- Features: Queue implementation with enqueue, dequeue, peek, and empty operations using two stacks.
- [See details and usage](DS-Algo/collections/QueueWithTwoStacks/README.md)

---

## Strings

### PalindromeChecker
Checks if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case. Efficient O(n) solution using a two-pointer approach.
- [See details and usage](DS-Algo/strings/PalindromeChecker/README.md)

### First Non-Repeating Character
Finds the index of the first non-repeating character in a string. Returns -1 if all characters repeat.
- [See details and usage](DS-Algo/strings/First-Non-Repeating-Char/README.md)

---

## Numbers

### FindMissingNumber
Finds the missing number in an array containing distinct integers from 1 to n+1. Implements both sum formula and XOR approaches.
- Features: Two algorithmic approaches (sum formula and XOR), O(n) time complexity.
- [See details and usage](DS-Algo/numbers/FindMissingNumber/README.md)

## How to Use
Each subproject contains its own README with build and run instructions. Most projects require Java JDK 8 or higher. Some use NetBeans/Ant project structure, but all can be compiled and run from the command line.
